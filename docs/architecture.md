(Not implemented as of now)
To tailor hypothesis generation to the desired conceptual intricacy, the system dynamically adjusts key parameters of the Large Language Model (LLM) based on the user-provided `complexity` level (1-10). This is achieved using the `get_generation_config` function:

```python
import types 

def get_generation_config(complexity: int):
    return types.GenerateContentConfig(
        temperature=min(0.3 + complexity * 0.05, 0.9),
        top_k=min(20 + complexity * 10, 100),
        top_p=0.9,
        max_output_tokens=512
    )

This function modulates temperature (controlling randomness/creativity) and top_k (limiting the pool of next-word choices) to scale with complexity. Lower complexity levels result in more focused and deterministic settings (e.g., temperature=0.35, top_k=30 for complexity 1), fostering grounded hypotheses. Higher levels increase these parameters (e.g., temperature=0.8, top_k=100 for complexity 10), allowing for more abstract and novel outputs. The min() function ensures these parameters stay within sensible upper bounds (0.9 for temperature, 100 for top_k). top_p is fixed at 0.9 for robust nucleus sampling, and max_output_tokens is set to 512 to provide ample length for any single hypothesis. This tailored configuration is then used for LLM inference, directly influencing the style and depth of the generated scientific hypothesis.
