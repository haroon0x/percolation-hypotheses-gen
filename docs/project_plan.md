# The Percolation Point Hypothesis Generator: Complete Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This project aims to build a hypothesis generation engine that demonstrates the "percolation point" - the theoretical limit where increasing hypothesis complexity leads to decreasing information density. The system will process scientific literature, generate hypotheses of varying complexity, and visualize the point where AI-generated hypotheses become unsupported by actual evidence.
